Welcome to FlipptoBooth. This MATLAB code uses frequency domain signals on the Flipp shirts to 
determine how far the user is from the camera. This could be used in the future to activate a 
photobooth to ensure subjects are an approriate distance fromm the camera. 

Run flippOut.m in MATLAB with any of the picture inputs (note 1 & 9) are the best.
ex. >> flippOut('pic1.jpg')
